Price Fluctuations and the Use of Bitcoin: An Empirical Inquiry
The aim of this paper is to provide an in-depth empirical study of Bitcoin's payment and investment features and their implications for e-commerce behavior. The paper also reports on the first global survey of merchants using this technology and modeling the share of sales charged for using this alternative currency, using both ordinary and Tobit regressions. This research looks at how region, consumer and company-specific characteristics interfere with Bitcoin's selling ratio. There is still no clear theory of how Bitcoin should be valued as it does not yield dividends, cash flows or profits due to its very existence. They opted instead to use an exploratory empirical study in the absence of apparent traditional valuation approaches. They also surveyed merchants who accept Bitcoin for online transactions and model the fraction of their revenue that this technology attributes to. This researcher’s consider that the company's features, the use of other payment methods, the awareness of customers about Bitcoin and the scale of both the official and unofficial economy are significant determinants. To some extent, these findings reflect vendors and customers ' incentives to adopt this new technology early in its genesis.
