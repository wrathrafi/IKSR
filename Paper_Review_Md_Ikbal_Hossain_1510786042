Price Fluctuations and the Use of Bitcoin: An Empirical Inquiry

"The aim of this paper is to provide an in-depth empirical study of Bitcoin's payment and investment features and their implications for
e-commerce behavior. The paper also reports on the first global survey of merchants using this technology and modeling the share of sales 
charged for using this alternative currency, using both ordinary and Tobit regressions. This research looks at how region, consumer and 
company-specific characteristics interfere with Bitcoin's selling ratio. There is still no clear theory of how Bitcoin should be valued as 
it does not yield dividends, cash flows or profits due to its very existence. They opted instead to use an exploratory empirical study in 
the absence of apparent traditional valuation approaches. They also surveyed merchants who accept Bitcoin for online transactions and 
model the fraction of their revenue that this technology attributes to. This researcher’s consider that the company's features, the use of 
other payment methods, the awareness of customers about Bitcoin and the scale of both the official and unofficial economy are significant 
determinants. To some extent, these findings reflect vendors and customers ' incentives to adopt this new technology early in its 
genesis."

Can artificial intelligence enhance the Bitcoin bonanza:

"The aim of this paper is to examine how the techniques of machine learning (ML) are used to forecast competitiveness prices. They react 
if strategies based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) will produce abnormal risk-adjusted returns when 
applied to Bitcoin, the largest digital currency in terms of market capitalization. Findings indicate that when using SVM, traders will 
receive conservative returns on a risk-adjusted basis, while taking into account transaction costs. The two sub-samples in the entire 
sample indicate that the underlying process has better memory than the first half for the second half of the results. While prices for 
Bitcoin have increased significantly in recent years,6 short-term fluctuations prevent a steady uptrend. The study's purpose in this 
context is to examine how artificial intelligence can help capture short-term patterns and provide incentives for abnormal returns. 
Overall, their results indicate that, depending on the method, the application of Artificial Intelligence techniques can be effective in 
both currency and cryptocurrency markets."

From chaining blocks to breaking even: A study on the profitability of bitcoin mining from 2012 to 2016

“Bitcoin is a commonly used payment method, but it is uncertain whether the system's proof of work existence is long-term financially 
sustainable. The researcher’s findings show that the amount of profit that Bitcoin mining has become less competitive over time. Using 
the e^3value approach, they examine the actors involved in the bitcoin system and the value flows between these actors. The value flows 
are calculated using data on the bitcoin network available to the public. In return for the security and transaction clearances they 
gave users, Bitcoin miners created over $2bln of bitcoin from 2012 to 2016. In order to earn these revenues, significant investments 
were needed in specialized equipment and operating energy costs. In short, the mined bitcoins should be worth more than the costs. This 
paper examined the long-term financial sustainability of Bitcoin network evidence mining. As a key factor to determine bitcoin 
sustainability, they considered miner's productivity through sustainable net positive cash flow. Through reversing the type and number 
of computers that mined bitcoin for the most part, we found a negative net cash flow.”
