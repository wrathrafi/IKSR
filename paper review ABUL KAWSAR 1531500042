paper no 1:
A Relative Study on Bitcoin Mining [1]: This paper is about bitcoin mining process of adding records oftransactions to
the bitcoin database of earlier transactions or blockchain from Bitcoin. This approach is organized as a faster system
between individuals or firms where the miners with different computational capabilities to solve a mathematical problem,
carry proof of work, enlarge their solution, and reach consent with it among the bitcoin network junctions. It says Bitcoin
was developed by someone named Satoshi Nakamoto, who later introduced his invention as open source code. A pure end-to-end
version of electronic cash would make it possible to send online payments directly from one individual to another without 
going through an economic entity. Bitcoin is the new currency on the Internet that anyone can start pulling out. It works 
well in anticipation of the excessive hashing power of any person or organized party. The paper indicates that at present,
90 percent of blocks are mined by known pools or miners syndicates,and if a few pools join together, they may cause changes 
and claim control over the network.


paper no 2:
The Bitcoin Lightning Network: 
Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments The Bitcoin Lightning Network, which is an extension of two-party payment channels applied
in such a way as to permit instant transactions between any number of participants.Lightning transactions are normal bitcoin 
transactions, but except for rare cases are not actually posted to the Block chain. Because the bulk of the transactional data
is stored privately, lightning transactions are expected to be significantly less expensive than on-chain bitcoin transactions,
thereby enabling affordable micropayments. Poon and Dryja’s vision may soon be realized, as Blockstream continues to work towards 
making the Lightning Network a reality.
   
   
paper no 3: Bitcoin in Islamic Banking and Finance

 Considering that Muslims make up about 25% of the world’s population, and that bitcoin is free of interest, Professor Charles
 Evans argues that the overlap between hard-money advocacy and Shari’a-compliant finance is large enough for these two communities
 to build intellectual bridges.This paperr has put bitcoin on the radar of many people previously far-removed from cryptocurrency,
 resulting in a surprising amount of attention from Muslims worldwide.
